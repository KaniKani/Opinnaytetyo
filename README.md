To start testing embedded systems, copy the file structure of this repository. With the commande "git clone https://github.com/KaniKani/Opinnaytetyo.git" in your Linux terminal

You will need some packages for anything to work so install Python3 via the command "sudo apt install python3" in the Linux terminal. Note that the command may vary a little depending on which Linux package management system you are using.

After installing python, install pip via the command "sudo apt install python3-pip"

Now with pip installed, we can install the pip packages within requirements.txt with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
